## How to Use

- Open the `.html` files in any modern browser.
- For projects with external CSS or JS, ensure to keep the files together (e.g., `image_resize.html`, `event.js`, and `act2.css`).
- Interact with forms, buttons, or inputs to see the exercises in action.

## Future Improvements

- Add more comments inside JS files for clarity.
- Use better input validation and UX improvements.
- Implement some projects using modern frameworks or enhanced styling.
